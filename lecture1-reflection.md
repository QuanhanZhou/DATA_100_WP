# Notes & Reflection:
It’s honorable to attend a data science meeting with Dr. Robinson. As a freshman at college and at the field of Data Science, I was roughly able to grasp a general picture of the Thursday lecture on Land Cover Mapping. Dr. Robinson introduced several functions of it, including the informative purpose for conservative actions of greening areas. During the meeting, a guest professor also impressed me by questioning practical uses of the mapping model in reality., I felt interested in this since I also intend to major in Mathematics. It would be engaging and useful to find some overlapping areas between math and data science.

The map Dr. Robinson showed also well reminds me of what we are going to learn in DATA100 — the administrative subdivisions of a country. You can zoom in to have a closer look at the high-resolution map or roughly discern each states or province based on the different colors it represents. I was amazed by the accuracy of that project on Thursday, but I understand that such demonstration may require incredibly amount of coding and debugging behind the scene. Overall, it’s a good experience to get touch with data science in this way and see some real applications in practice.
